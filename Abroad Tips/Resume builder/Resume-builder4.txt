LANGUAGES (should i need to include this section? or attach with any other section? or should i include soft skill or hobbies section or other section and include all my details there? suggest me..) - but i am thinking to remove (since english is alone relevant for applying and my resume is in english)
English (Professional) | Tamil (Native) | Sourashtra (Conversational)

----------------------------

so yea this is my content. so basically wanna make this resume to appeal to global and international recruiters.
also the content should be within one page too, as recommended by many professionals.


----------------------------

personal notes for experice section:
what did i do, how did i do it, what was the result 
accomplised x as measured by y by doing z

----------------------------

also how to tell without telling i may be the best canditate for your company?

----------------------------

also after resume creating, i saw a hack, adding all ats keywords in my resume on out of bounds part and hiding it using white text and add extra text that says(modern ats probem require modern ats solution). 

i actually find this funny, but will this work for interview calls? since i think this is silly, but mayb be risky?

one more quote i saw now is - your resume should be selling your experience, not summarising it

----------------------------

also i have statistics info from a top website - https://cultivatedculture.com/resume-statistics/

Resume Statistics: A Summary Of Our Key Findings
1Including a LinkedIn profile has been shown to boost interview rates, but only 48% of resumes included a link to a LinkedIn profile
2Including relevant skills and keywords boosts your chances of landing an interview, but candidates only included 51% of relevant keywords in their resume (with a 60% match rate for hard skills and only a 28% match rate for soft skills)
3Metrics and numbers are a best practice for illustrating and selling a candidate's value, but only 26% of resumes included at least five instances of measurable results, metrics, or value and 36% of resumes had zero instances of metrics
4Recent data shows that the ideal resume length is 475 – 600 words, 77% of resumes were outside of that range
5One of the easiest ways to lose your reader is by including too much fluff and too many irrelevant buzzwords — 51% of resumes included fluffy buzzwords, cliches, or the incorrect use of pronouns

so need to make this 5 golden rule in my resume

About the job
At JetBrains, code is our passion. Ever since we started, back in 2000, we have strived to make the strongest, most effective developer tools on earth. By automating routine checks and corrections, our tools speed up production, freeing developers to grow, discover, and create.

We're currently building No Pressure, an AI-powered simulator for role-playing and debugging difficult conversations (such as feedback, conflict, negotiation, and others). It is a human-centered, UX-first AI product – a web application with interactive conversational AI that helps people learn through virtual meetings with AI characters.

We’ve completed an MVP, secured the budget for its further development, and are now moving into the pilot phase with our first customers. It’s a bold, design-led, user-first product, and we’re looking for people who are excited to build something truly new, meaningful, and well-crafted from the ground up.

About The Role:

You’ll be a hands-on frontend developer building and scaling a UX-first AI product from MVP to pilot and beyond. You’ll own the frontend of the product, implementing complex, user-facing features – from learning flows and AI-driven interactions to admin dashboards, analytics, and billing – working closely with design and product teams to deliver fast, clean, and production-ready experiences.

This role is senior in scope. We’re looking for a frontend engineer who is comfortable owning large parts of the product, making architectural decisions, and shaping how the frontend evolves as the product scales. You’re expected to proactively suggest solutions and improvements, while also respecting and accurately implementing product and design decisions.

In This Role, You Will:

Own the frontend of product features, including learning paths, recommendations, the AI coach, and real conversation debugger.
Build and support frontend experiences for AI/agent-driven workflows and interactive conversational interfaces.
Build and maintain admin interfaces, including dashboards, analytics views, reporting, and configuration panels.
Implement the UI for core product functionality, including billing, roles and permissions, and usage tracking.
Turn prototypes into scalable, maintainable architecture.
Develop the frontend codebase, shaping its architecture, and making technical decisions to ensure scalability and maintainability as the product grows.

Requirements

Must have:

3+ years of professional frontend web development experience.
Strong experience with React and TypeScript.
The proven ability to build responsive, interactive UIs (forms, dashboards, and modals).
Experience prototyping quickly and iterating into production-quality code.
The ability to write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
Good design sensibilities and attention to UI/UX details.
Experience working closely with Figma and design prototypes.
A solid understanding of client-server architecture and REST APIs.
A bachelor’s or master’s degree in computer science, engineering, IT, mathematics, or a related field.

Nice To Have:

Experience with real-time communication (WebRTC, LiveKit, or similar).
Experience integrating AI/LLM-based features into frontend applications.
Experience building SaaS products.
Familiarity with frontend-adjacent infrastructure and tooling (e.g. Docker, CI/CD pipelines, error monitoring tools, basic deployment, or environment setup).
Experience with design systems or reusable component libraries (Figma + scalable UI).
Familiarity with product analytics and usage tracking.

Qualities And Experience

Must have:

A strong sense of ownership and responsibility.
A focus on real product impact, not just implementation.
The ability to balance initiative and autonomy with strong respect for design intent and product direction.
Experience making frontend architecture or technical decisions within an existing product.
Experience working cross-functionally with designers, PMs, or stakeholders.
Clear evidence of skill growth, role progression, or increasing scope over time.

Nice To Have:

Experience in early-stage startups or 0→1 products.
Comfort working in fast-moving, ambiguous environments.
Experience owning features or product areas end to end.
Mentorship or knowledge-sharing experience.
The ability to learn new tools and frameworks or switch tech stacks confidently.
Experience working directly with end users.
Openness, empathy, kindness, and strong communication skills.

In effect: we know we have a product experience and funnel that works quite well. Now we want to optimize, tune, and make it even more amazing (and measure even more). We’re looking for an experienced engineer who has worked on projects that generated measurable business impact. You’ll work closely with Postman’s engineering leadership and our product and design teams to achieve our mission of connecting 100M developers in the world. We specifically hope this person is you, because while the team is small right now, we want an eager, curious engineer who cares about building experiences that delight, convert, and measurably impact the business and work with a team of like-minded individuals who care deeply, too.

What You’ll Do

To achieve our goals, we’ll need a talented, experienced, and thoughtful engineer with a special interest and aptitude for growth. We are looking for someone who cares deeply about the details and spends time building user interfaces that delight users. We need an engineer who can be somewhat self-directed and who has great taste, judgment, and can iterate (and ship!) quickly to achieve the iterative improvements to our first-time user experience. To quote Frank Slootman (former Snowflake CEO):

“Strategy is overrated and execution is severely underrated. Mostly all companies plan well and mostly all companies fail at execution. Make execution the king in your company.” – Frank Slootman, Amp it Up

Execution Is Key On The Growth Engineering Team. We’ll Need Someone Who Relentlessly Leads By Example On Execution And Ships Measurably Impactful Changes Regularly To The User Experience Of Postman. We’ll Progress And Continuously Improve Towards Achieving Our Goals And Metrics And Most Importantly We’ll Deliver An Increasingly Delightful Product Experience That Developers Love To Use. You Should Expect To

Own and deliver. Deliver improvements to the core product experience that help us achieve our goals around onboarding and activation
Deliver little big changes. Deliver small, measured changes that meaningfully impact end users and successful activation of these users

Experiment and identify winners. We have a great foundation of experimentation on the team and you will need to leverage and improve this foundation to ship A/B tested changes that we know have an impact on our goals. 

Own end-to-end workflows. Own end-to-end and understand core workflows, driving measurable improvements to user experience particularly focused on first-time user experience (sign-up, onboarding, and beyond)
Deeply understand the user. Collaborate and work with end users (developers!) using Postman to understand their core workflows and then use that knowledge to improve our product
Learn and grow. Broaden your knowledge of the core product and the domain over time, starting with first-time UX but eventually branching out into driving improvement to deeper experiences on the Postman user’s journey, and 
Collaborate across boundaries and geographies. Collaborate on team processes to streamline collaboration across US and India team members

About You

Must have:

At least 5+ years of experience building frontend and/or full-stack projects and user experiences. 
Track record of delivering impactful and engaging user experiences that delight users
Deep expertise in building the modern web with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You likely have used libraries or frameworks like React or Next.js, but we care much more about the fundamentals than the tech stack.
Excellent communication skills. We’re a remote-first team and we’re going to be moving fast together. Good communication is key.
Detail oriented. We have to care about the details, and while we don’t expect you to be a designer, you need to care about the product experience that our teams are shipping.
Measure twice, cut once. We expect that you are analytical by nature and have experience in delivering features, improvements, and changes that leverage analytics tools (like LaunchDarkly) and experimentation techniques. 
Customer obsession. As we are a core product with years of muscle memory, we need an engineer who is able and willing to leverage the voice of the customer to expedite decision making, develop conviction, and most importantly delight our user.
Based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Nice-to-have

Experience working with or using full-stack JavaScript / TypeScript
Experience working in a React application with state management tools like MobX
Experience working on B2B product and/or developer tools

The reasonably estimated base salary for this role ranges from $110,000 to $180,000, plus a competitive equity package. Actual compensation is based on the candidate's skills, qualifications, and experience.

What Else?

In addition to Postman's pay-on-performance philosophy, and a flexible schedule working with a fun, collaborative team, Postman offers a comprehensive set of benefits, including full medical coverage, flexible PTO, wellness reimbursement, and a monthly lunch stipend. Along with that, our wellness programs will help you stay in the best of your physical and mental health. Our frequent and fascinating team-building events will keep you connected, while our donation-matching program can support the causes you care about. We’re building a long-term company with an inclusive culture where everyone can be the best version of themselves.

At Postman, we embrace a hybrid work model. For all roles based out of San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Austin, Tokyo, Bangalore, Hyderabad, London, and New York, employees are expected to come into the office 3-days a week. We were thoughtful in our approach which is based on balancing flexibility and collaboration and grounded in feedback from our workforce, leadership team, and peers. The benefits of our hybrid office model will be shared knowledge, brainstorming sessions, communication, and building trust in-person that cannot be replicated via zoom.

Our Values

At Postman, we create with the same curiosity that we see in our users. We value transparency and honest communication about not only successes, but also failures. In our work, we focus on specific goals that add up to a larger vision. Our inclusive work culture ensures that everyone is valued equally as important pieces of our final product. We are dedicated to delivering the best products we can.

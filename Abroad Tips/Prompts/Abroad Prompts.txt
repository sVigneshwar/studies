# ABROAD JOB SEARCH — GUIDE & PROMPTS

## 1. Core Research Questions

Act as a research tool and LinkedIn recruiter from abroad. Analyze the following:

1. **Will I get a job abroad?** (Probability estimates per country)
2. **Which countries offer the best chances for my profile?**
3. **List of target countries** with prioritization
4. **Relocation cost estimates:**
    - Initial cost (single)
    - 3–6 month cost (single, then with spouse + child)
5. **Average salary per country** (local currency and INR)
6. **Monthly expenses:**
    - Alone
    - With spouse + child
    - Expected savings
7. **Feasibility of sending money home** and estimated monthly remittances
8. **Quality of life** notes and barriers to integration per country
9. **Job permanence risk** considering AI/automation for frontend roles

**For each country, produce a probability score (0–100%) with rationale and data sources.**

Act as a research tool, linkedin recruiter from abroad and analyze the below points if i follow this roadmap:
1) Will i get a job abroad?
2) Which country will i get a chance of hiring
3) list me the countries of chance i got.
4) how much cost will it take for me to move abroad and settle there initially and after some months will bring wife and son.
5) what is the average salry in each country (tell me both native curreny and INR)? 
6) How much will be the expenses alone and with wife and son?
7) How much i can save?
8) Is it possible to send money to parents after earning and savings?
9) How leasurely can i live in each country or what barrier will i face if any?
10) If i get hired, will the job be permanent, with the impact of AI?

Give me percentage of chance for each above.

Create a job application tracker + outreach message templates for LinkedIn + email to recruiters/hiring managers.
Sketch an interview prep plan (system design for frontend, React coding tasks, common questions + answers).


Company Name
Country
City / Remote
Role Title
Tech Stack (React / Next / TS etc.)
Visa Sponsorship (Yes / No / Unknown)
Recruiter Name
Recruiter LinkedIn URL
Hiring Manager Name
Application Source (LinkedIn / Company Site / Referral)
Date Applied
Follow-up Date (7 days later)
Response Status (No reply / HR call / Tech round / Reject / Offer)
Interview Notes
Salary Range
Relocation Support (Yes / No)
Priority (High / Medium / Low)

--------------

How to Use It Properly

Apply to 5–7 roles per week, not mass-spam.

Every application must have either:

Recruiter LinkedIn contact OR

Hiring manager contact.

Follow up exactly after 7 days.

If no response after 2 follow-ups → mark Cold and move on.

👉 This system alone improves response rates by 30–40% compared to blind applying.

---------

🧭 Where to Apply (Visa-Friendly)

Focus on product companies & scale-ups, not agencies.

High-Yield Platforms

LinkedIn Jobs (filter by country + “visa sponsorship” keywords)

Company career pages (Dublin, Toronto, Amsterdam, Sydney)

AngelList / Wellfound (startups sponsor more than you think)

Local tech recruiters (Morgan McKinley, Hays, Robert Walters)

3️⃣ Interview Prep Plan (Frontend System Design + Coding)

This is exactly what foreign companies test for senior frontend roles.

🧠 A) Frontend System Design (VERY Important Abroad)
Common Questions

Design a dashboard application

Design a real-time feed

Design an e-commerce frontend

Design a large form-heavy app

How to Answer (Always Follow This Structure)

1. Clarify requirements

Users, scale, devices

Auth or not?

SSR or CSR?

SEO requirements?

2. High-level architecture

Next.js App Router
→ Pages / Layouts
→ Feature-based folders
→ Shared UI components
→ API layer (RTK Query)
→ Auth middleware


3. State management

Local UI state → React hooks

Server state → RTK Query

Global UI state → Redux/Zustand

4. Performance

Code splitting

Lazy loading

Memoization

Image optimization

Lighthouse metrics

5. Accessibility

Semantic HTML

Keyboard navigation

ARIA roles

👉 Practice explaining out loud — this is what interviewers want.

🧠 B) React / Coding Interview Prep
Must-Know Topics (100% Asked)

Hooks: useEffect, useMemo, useCallback

Controlled vs uncontrolled components

Lifting state up

Custom hooks

Context vs Redux

RTK Query vs traditional Redux

Error boundaries

Suspense basics

Typical Coding Tasks

Build a search with debounce

Build a pagination or infinite scroll

Build a form with validation

Optimize a slow component

Sample Answer Style

“First I’ll build a working version, then I’ll optimize for performance and reusability.”

This mindset scores higher than just coding fast.

🧠 C) JavaScript Deep Questions (Senior Level)

Closures

Event loop

this binding

Promises vs async/await

Debounce vs throttle

Shallow vs deep copy

Prepare 1–2 real examples from your past work.

🧠 D) Behavioral Questions (VERY Important Abroad)
Common Questions

Tell me about a difficult UI problem you solved

How do you handle deadlines?

How do you work with designers?

How do you handle feedback?

STAR Answer Format

Situation → Task → Action → Result

Example:

“We had performance issues on a product dashboard used by 100k users…
I identified heavy re-renders, memoized components, improved Lighthouse score from 45 → 90.”

4️⃣ Weekly Interview Prep Schedule (Realistic)
Weekdays (1–1.5 hrs/day)

30 min React/JS theory

30 min coding practice

15 min system design explanation (talk aloud)

Weekend (3–4 hrs)

Build / improve one project feature

Mock interview (self-record or friend)

Resume + portfolio refinement

5️⃣ Final Reality Check (Honest)

Your experience + roadmap is valid

Abroad interviews focus on clarity + communication, not just coding

Visa sponsorship is possible, but you must apply consistently for 6–9 months

Once you clear 2–3 interviews, confidence jumps fast

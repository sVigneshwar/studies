  |-- Does the data CHANGE over time?
  |        |
  |        |-- NO → Just use a normal prop/variable.
  |        |
  |        |-- YES → Needs STATE.
  |
  |-- Who NEEDS this state?
          |
          |-- Only ONE component → keep state LOCAL in that component.
          |
          |-- Multiple SIBLINGS need it → LIFT state UP to their parent.
          |
          |-- Many UNRELATED components need it (passing too many props) →
                 → Use CONTEXT (or Redux if complex).

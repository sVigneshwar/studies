API:
Application programming interface

fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")

---------------------------------------

Rest API:
Representational state transfer: 

set of rules to call a API

/users, /post/1/comments
uses HTTP method to perform action on thise resource
return data in JSON format
is stateless (each request in independent)

---------------------------------------

HTTP Methods:
GET - Get all the datas
POST - creates new data and sends
PUT - replaces existing data
PATCH - updates a particular value in a data
DELETE - deletes a data

---------------------------------------

HTTP Status codes:
200 - success
201 - created - new resource
400 - client error - bad request or validation error
401 - unauthorized - missing or invalid crendential
403 - forbidden - authenticated but not allowed
404 - not found - resource not found
500 - server error - somthing went wrong on the server

---------------------------------------

Rest api structure:

rest endpoint:
https://api.example.com/resouce/

/users - all users
/users/1 - user with id 1
/users/1/posts - all post from user with id 1

a rest defined how to manipulate using http verbs (like we can call each of this individually using https methods)

---------------------------------------

Core REST Principles:

statelessness - server doesnt remember previous call, each call are independent
resouce based url - URL represent resource [/resouce/users] not [/getusers?id=1]
uniform interface - same rules for all endpoints (consistent naming, JSON Format)
client-server seperation - frontend and backend (client and server) are independent
idempotency - repeating same request provides same result (important for put and delete)


1) i dont think there will be any issue, but giving that content type is necessary as that i know of
2) res.ok checks whther the response is true or false, res.status provides a number, with which what exact error happend like 200, 201, 400, 401, 402, 404, 500
3) it means, it got deleted, but does not need to return any data from server side, so the status is 204

create a chat app using this data

LHS should have the tabs of each user
RHS should have chatbox, and send button with email id in button


while type, the text should be updated
while send, the text should be alerted with email address
after alert, reset the chat text box
while changing tab, the text should be reset (check if the text can be restored for each user while switching tabs atlast)

Main Hooks:
useState - understood
useReducer - understood
useEffect - understood
useMemo - understood
useCallback - understood
useContext - understood
useRef - understood
Custom Hooks - foundation understood (but need to train more creating custom hooks)

others hooks:
useLayoutEffect
useTransition
useDefferedValue
useImperativeHandle
useDebugValue
useID
useEffectEvent
condition Hooks?
useFormStatus
useOptimistic
useActionState

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main Hooks:

useState:
1) manage state using useState
ex - const[count, seCount] = useState("0");
---------
useReducer:
1) we can call dispatcher for to perform certain action, along with passing state values
ex - 
const [todo, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, [])

onClick={()=>dispatch({type: 'add-todo', payload: {name: name}})}

on reducer function we can write like below (use if conditon or switch condition)

function reducer(todo, action){
  switch(action.type){
    case: 'add-todo':
      return [...todo, {name: name}]
  }
}
---------
useEffect:
1)basically this function calls if anything is re-rendere/ or rendered for the first time. 
2)state must need to be changed if called
3)ex - useEffect(()=>console.log(reder), [count]) - if the final [] array passed empty, then it only runs 1st time (only while mounting)
4)when return inside useEffectcalled, it is cleanup. it cleans up and then proceed other updated. if component is removed, the cleanup code runs once. so it is good code method to cleanup.
---------
useMemo:
1) if a component has two state dependency, one is slow and one if fast, if we re-render component by changing a state value, the slow function also re-render, making the performance slow.
so we can avoid re-rendering slow function, but using useMemo, so that the slow function only runs when the actual value for the slow function is changed.

2) tricky situation (referential memorization): if we are using useEffect, while rendering a comopnent, it works, but while changing a another component also, this useEffect may run.
so we can avoid re-rendering useeffect, by using useMemo, so that the changes happens only on changing specific values.
this case comes while calling static variable inside a component, like theme. (memorization of object inside a component)
3)useCallback returns memoised function, whereas useMemo returns a memoised value.
---------
useCallback:
1)syntax same as useMemo
2)useMemo returns a value, but useCallback return the whole function, so we can use any paramerter of the function
3)it is used to remove recreation of function each time unnecassarily
4)useCallback returns memoised function, whereas useMemo returns a memoised value.
---------
useContext:
1) pass value throughout the component using react.createcontext() hook, used to avoid prop drilling in deeply nested components
---------
useRef:
(mainly it does not re-render while component re-renders, it walys stays static)
1) useref stores a value in a object with the current key.
2) it can be used to target a element using ref attribute. 
3) it can be used to store a previous value state
4) can get how much time a component is rendered
---------
Custom Hooks:
1)we can use other hook method to our advantage and create a custom hook based for our requirements and use it throughout our project.
---------

others hooks:

useLayoutEffect
useTransition
useDefferedValue
useImperativeHandle
useDebugValue
useID
useEffectEvent
condition Hooks?
useFormStatus
useOptimistic
useActionState

3 - advanced topics: (Completed)
react example from web dev simplified (Completed)

4 - ecosystem:
- api calls, what is restful api? (axios? )
- redux (state management)
- router
- jest + react testing library


--------

Do the below mini projects in react:
To-Do List (arrays, events) (Completed)
Fetch & display GitHub users (API + async/await)
Counter app (state & props)
Weather app (API + useEffect)
Notes app with localStorage (state persistence)

--------

watch the ecommerce site from the tamil youtube channel

--------

Typescript:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

router (basic structure work) - ok
fetch data (basic structure work) - ok
do basic counter app in useReducer - ok
do basic todo app in useReducer - ok
git deploy page - ok
redux (do basic counter app first) - ok

start doing mini projects using redux:
- To-Do List (arrays, events) + counter app in redux (with router nav for both app)  - ok
- Fetch & display GitHub users (API + async/await) (check thunk in redux) - ok
- Weather app (API + useEffect)
- Notes app with localStorage (state persistence) - ok
- do a ecommerce base app using redux

plan update 27-12-2025:
1)learning react typescript from code evolution youtube channel
2)create a basic todo app with TS alone
3)create a basic todo app with react + TS
4)get confident in react hooks and create some custom hooks
5)revisit topic covering:
- createAsyncThunk - create a project with basic api calls using thunk
- RTK Query - create a project with basic api calls using RTK query
- RESTful APIs - theory + examples
- Axios / Fetch - create a project with axios api calls + interceptors
- JWT Auth - create a project with full login/logout + token handling
- Formik / React Hook Form - create a project with form building + validation (with both formik/yup and react hook form)
- Jest + RTL (Testing) - create a project with unit & integration testing
6)create a basic expense tracker app with react TS
7)create a basic auth dashboard app with react TS + redux (login, dashboard, logout) [with axios interceptors for token handling]
8)create some projects with react TS + redux
9)start preparing interview question for js, react, TS - get confident like prepare to answer whenever asked (mock interviews)
10)after this go to ci/cd and next js. because before moving to these topic we should be strong in react + TS

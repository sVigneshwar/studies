Open this link
Find a hidden URL within the HTML
Each character of the URL is given by this DOM tree, in this specific order. You need to find (in order) all of the occurrences and join them to get the link.
The asterisk (*) is a wildcard representing zero or more characters that can be present in the string. These characters are irrelevant to the result and should be ignored.
There can be zero or more DOM nodes between each valid tag. These nodes are irrelevant to the result.
Any additional attribute that doesn't interfere with the described pattern can be safely ignored.
Pattern of the DOM tree for each valid character of the URL

<section data-id="92*">
  <article data-class="*45">
    <div data-tag="*78*">
      <b class="ref" value="VALID_CHARACTER"></b>
    </div>
  </article>
</section>
(To validate this step, you should be able to open the URL and get an English word. This means you have captured the flag! 🥳)

SUBMISSION Open the src/flag file and change the FLAG variable to the found word. Don't modify the file further or it will be incorrectly graded

React challenge
Make an HTTP request to URL obtained in the previous CTF to load the obtained flag into a React component
Don't use any external libraries. Use browser APIs
Render a Loading text while the request is ongoing
Render the flag you loaded in step 1 with the following conditions:
Simulate a typewriter effect with a half second delay between each character. Start showing nothing and then display characters one by one until the full string is displayed.
No style required
Animation should trigger after you load the flag
Animation should run only once
Use React APIs only. Don't use CSS or external libraries
Bonus: Add as a comment the script you used to to get the flag in the previous challenge

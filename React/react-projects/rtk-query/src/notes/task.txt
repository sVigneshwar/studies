🧩 Task: “Simple Posts Manager”

Goal:
Build a small app that uses RTK Query to:

Fetch all posts from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Add a new post (POST)

Delete a post (DELETE)

🔧 Requirements

Create an API slice named postApi

Base URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Endpoints:

getPosts → GET /posts

addPost → POST /posts

deletePost → DELETE /posts/:id

Create a component (like App.js) that:

Displays the first 10 posts (title only)

Has an input field + button to add a new post (title only is fine)

Each post has a delete button beside it

When you add or delete a post:

The post list should automatically update (no manual refetch)

Use tags (providesTags / invalidatesTags) to achieve this.

⚡ Bonus (if you want to challenge yourself)

Add a loading indicator and error message for the GET call.

Show a toast or alert when a post is successfully added/deleted.

When you’re done, tell me —
I’ll help you review it line by line and explain exactly what’s happening under the hood.

Do you want me to tell you what “tags” you’ll likely need for the auto-update part before you start, or do you want to try it blindly first and then we fix it together?

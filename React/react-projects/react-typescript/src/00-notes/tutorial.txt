React typescript tutorial:
1) Intro - what and why
2) Getting started - setting up project folders
3) typing props
example: 
- Greet component with name prop of type string
4) Basic Props
example: 
- Greet with number of message(number) and isLoggedIn (boolean)
- Person component with name object containing first and last name (object) 
- PersonList component with array of person objects (array)
5) Advanced Props
example:
- Status component with status prop of specific string values (literal types)
- Heading component with children prop (children: string)
- Oscar component with children prop (children: React.ReactNode)
- Greet component with optional props (message?: number)
6) event props
example:
- Button component with onClick event handler (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>)
- Input component with onChange event handler (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>)
- These 2 handlers are the most common event handlers in React, so it's important to know how to type them correctly in TypeScript.
- there are other useful event handlers like form submit, keyboard events, etc.
7) Style props
- Container component with styles prop (styles: React.CSSProperties)
(So basically while passing any props, we should always use "type componentProps = {propname: proptype}", we cannot target without prop names)

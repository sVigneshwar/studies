Running Coverage: npm test -- --coverage
wha to test vs ignore:
 - test public api (user interactions, outputs)
 - avoid testing implementation details (state, props, methods)
 - avoid over mocking (mock only external dependencies)
avoid implementation details:
 - test what the user sees and interacts with
 - avoid testing internal state or methods
 - avoid testing component internals (state, props)
snapshot testing:
    - useful for small, stable components
    - avoid for large, complex components
    - avoid for frequently changing components

tutorial points:
1) base strucutire of RTL 
    - (test block = render -> find elements user interacts -> interact with those elements -> assert thr results are expected)
2) base selectors of jest 
    - (getBy, findBy, queryBy, getAllBy, findAllBy, queryAllBy, )
    - first get by role, placeholdertext, get by text, label text
    - next if cannot use first, target by semantic elements - getbytitle, getbytitle
    - at verylast and never use this - data-testid="testid" getbytestid
3) how to use selectors in different way
4) how to use expect (assertions)
    - toBeInTheDocument, toBeTruthy, not.toBeInTheDocument, tobeTextContent,etc...
5) describe block
6) fireEvent
    - user click events, mock a dummy function using jest.fn() -> this is a empty function that does nothing.
7) integration testing
    - typing, clicking buttton, todo added, todo completed
8) asynchronous testing
    - testing asynchronous data using finby and findAllBy async await
9) mocking api
    - real api cost money, waiting time, dependent on real data or something external

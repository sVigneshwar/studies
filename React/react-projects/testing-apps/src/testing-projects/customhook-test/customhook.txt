1)for saving local storage create a new custom hook, in which we pass a key and value (name, '')
2)in uselocalstorage custom hook, we get key and initialvalue from the parent (name, '') coming from parent
3)we need usestate, since we are replicating usestate hook
4)we save value, setvalue in usestate(()=>getlocalstorage()), usestate can be passed as function, which will take the return value as initial(render) state
5)in getlocalstorage, we check if name is in localstorage, if not we pass initialvalue coming from parent, or we take get localstorage value and return it to useState hook
6)in the render function we use useeffect for to keep on updating the name key in localstorage using setitem for each render
7)finaly we return the value and setvalue from uselocalstorage, to the parent function

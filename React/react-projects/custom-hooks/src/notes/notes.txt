check repetitive usage of a component
extract the repetitive logic into a seperate function, only logic should be abstracted, not the ui
check what is needed for the component and return that only.
use the hook in component in a simpler way as possible


setState ONLY? ────────► keep useState in component
setState + SOMETHING(LOGIC)? ─► move to custom hook




so basically if state is simply, then keep it in compoentn, like upting the ui alone.
and if after updating the state, if we use the state to do anything with reference to the state, like validation ,localstorage, calculation, sideeffect if any,. thenmove it to customhook

Am i right?

So now, ask me mini quiz with 5 - 10 questions of whether useState should be moved or not


KEEP useState
MOVE to custom hook

1 KEEP useState
2 MOVE to custom hook
3 KEEP useState
4 MOVE to custom hook
5 MOVE to custom hook
6 KEEP useState
7 MOVE to custom hook
8 MOVE to custom hook
9 MOVE to custom hook
10 KEEP useState

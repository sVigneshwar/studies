check repetitive usage of a component
extract the repetitive logic into a seperate function, only logic should be abstracted, not the ui
check what is needed for the component and return that only.
use the hook in component in a simpler way as possible


setState ONLY? ────────► keep useState in component
setState + SOMETHING(LOGIC)? ─► move to custom hook




so basically if state is simply, then keep it in compoentn, like upting the ui alone.
and if after updating the state, if we use the state to do anything with reference to the state, like validation ,localstorage, calculation, sideeffect if any,. thenmove it to customhook



in usehook -> add initialvalue -> add newvalue, setNewValue with usestate(initiavalue)

updater function from component

const updatedvalue, while setting the values from component, here also need to update the newValue so taht we can return it with

val => setNewValue(val)
after that run the sideeffect, or validatiom, calculations logics

then return the newValue to be used in the component
return updatedvalue function to be used in the component setName property in useState in the component
